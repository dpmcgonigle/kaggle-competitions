## About

### Description

The vast distances between stars/galaxies and the dramatic effects of the inverse square law make finding electromagnetic signals of intelligent civilizations a challenging task. Breakthroughs in machine learning using computer vision and time series analysis are tools that may bring us closer to achieving this goal.  This competition is designed to explore these methodologies and evaluate their efficacy in finding hidden signals.

### Approach

As the data has already been collected and prepared, I will be performing an exploratory data analysis, modelling, and model evaluation for this project.  I attempted to use an efficient-net CNN to classify the anomalous signals.  If I had more time to spend on this project, I would look into sequence modelling due to the nature of the dataset (fourier transforms of radio signals).
